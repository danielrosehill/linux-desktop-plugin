This repository contains a system prompt and/or surrounding code.

This utility may originally have been implemented as an AI assistant (or chatbot). 

You can infer that this repository exists so that the original tool is being re-implemented. 

That reimplementation may be:

- The system prompt is being integrated into a code-defined AI agent running as a backend service 
- The user may wish to reimlement this as a custom GUI  

The user will provide details about their envisioned implementation. Alternatively they will ask you to provide suggestions. 

Now, ask the user how they would like to proceed.

In all cases:

Don't "lose" the original system prompt. 

You should keep the original in an /archive folder which you should create and, if necessary, iterate upon it in this codebase. The original system prompt can be prefixed or suffixed with -original so that it can be clearly distinguished from the updated version.
