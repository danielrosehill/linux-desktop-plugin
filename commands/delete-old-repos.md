This level of my filesystem is where I store github repos.

Please help me to clean it up a bit.

Here's how I'd like you to help me "prune":

- Looking at the last modified date for each folder, identify repositories which I have not edited in over 3 months
- We can infer that these repos are no longer needed on my local. In the "worst case" I can just reclone them; so dont worry about deleting data
- Delete these repos locally by deleting the folders

In addition (step two):

- See if you can identify repos that look like they were "one time projects". These are repos I may have created for a single time-limited purpose and which I do not need to keep locally.

If you're not sure about whether a repo should be deleted, even though it seems to meet either rule, just ask.
