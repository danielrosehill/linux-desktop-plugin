Flatten the folder hierarchy.

All the files in the subfolders should be moved to this level in the filesystem.

Resolve any filename clashes by appending unique characters.

If this directory structure contains media (images or video) then after flattening the hierarchy ask me (the user) if I would like you to run a checksum based check to identify and remove any duplicates.
