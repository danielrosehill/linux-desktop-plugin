This level of my filesystem contains repositories.

I would like you to help me organise the folder.

To do this:

- Identify common purposes that straddle multiple projects. You can infer the theme of the repository by its name in the filesystem.

Then:

- Organise those repositories into subfolders.

The thematic subfolders may already exist or you may need to create it. You can determine whether a folder is a repostiry or an organisation folder if you are unsure by inspecting its contents and seeing whether it contains a .git (etc).

Try to strike a balance when organising: we don't want so many organisation folders that they're overly specific and we end up with as many folders as there are repositories. Avoid being overly granular. But achieve a reasonable level of topic clustering.

If you identify that a number of repos do not fit  cleanly into any one of the existing topics (or those you create) you can create a misc folder to hold them.
