I would like to add a bash alias. I will provide the alias or ask for your suggestions as to an appropriate alias.

To come up with an appropriate alias - identify one that is unlikely to conflict with other aliases.

Either way:

Create the new bash alias(es) in ~/.bash_aliases

Then you can use sourcebash to reload the bash alias file.
